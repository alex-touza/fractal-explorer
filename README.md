# Fractal Explorer - Mathematical and Computational Study of Fractal Objects

**Mathematical and computational study of fractal objects** is my research project ("Treball de recerca") for my last two years of high school ("Batxillerat").

This project studied the mathematical basis the mathematical basis of fractal geometry and the generation of fractal objects, exploring topology &mdash;a branch of advanced mathematics&mdash; while maintaining mathematical rigor. 

This repository contains both the source code for the end product of my research &mdash;a web app that generates fractals and
provides mathematical insight developed with TypeScript and WebGL&mdash; ([`web`](./web) module), the paper of the project ([`paper`](./paper)
module) and the presentation ([`presentation`](./presentation) module), both in Typst.

## State of the project

As of December 2024, the project has been successfully submitted to the professors. It has received the maximum grade.

The author, however, isn't completely satisfied with the priject. Over the following months, the theoretical study will be extended and the web app will be worked on further.

## Methodology

The paper and the presentation use Typst, a powerful typesetting system (better than LaTeX).

The web technologies used are listed here.

- Astro + Vite (to be replaced by a bare Vite stack)
- TypeScript
- WebGL

## Development

It is recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA to open the whole project. Other IDEs may be used to open each module.

Use the following commands to initiate the web server (Node.js required):

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run dev

```

## Tutor

José Ramírez has been the tutor for this project.
