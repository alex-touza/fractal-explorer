# Fractal Explorer - Mathematical and Computational Study of Fractal Objects

**Mathematical and computational study of fractal objects** is my research project ("Treball de recerca") for my last two years of high school ("Batxillerat").

This repository contains both the source code for the end product of my research &mdash;a web app that generates fractals and
provides mathematical insight&mdash; ([`web`](./web) module), and the source for the paper of the project ([`paper`](./paper)
module), written in Typst.

## Development

It is recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA to open the whole project. Other IDEs may be used to open each module.

## Tutor

José Ramírez has been the tutor for this project.
